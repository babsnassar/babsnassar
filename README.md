# Hi there, I'm BÃ¡rbara Nassar ðŸ‘‹

Originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, I moved to Berlin and just completed a full stack web development course at Le Wagon. 

I am combining my work experience as project manager and content strategist with technology to direct my career towards frontend developer. 

> **Personal project:** In 2018 I created a website where I teach, help and encourage other women to earn money from their websites and achieve the long-awaited financial freedom (www.bloga.ai - for Portuguese speakers).
